```sh
       $ cd ./document_analyse
```

- Run:

```sh
       $ docker-compose build
```

This will run all the initial setups required and start the server, generate the minimal **.env file** required to run the backend, spins-up all containers defined in the docker-compose file.

In case you're facing issues after running the above, like make: Error,
kindly run this before the above command:

```sh
       $ docker-compose up
```

- Run the server:

Subsequently, to start and stop the docker containers, you run the following

To start:

```sh
       $ docker-compose start
```

To stop:

- Stop the running container

```sh
       $ docker-compose stop
```

- Stop & remove the running container

```sh
       $ docker-compose down
```
