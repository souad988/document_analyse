# To improve:

#### Model Training Locally:
  Currently, the project relies on external APIs for question-answering and text summarization. Consider exploring the option of downloading pre-trained models and hosting them locally for improved accuracy.
#### Includes other file formats:
  The current implementation of the document upload functionality is designed to accept PDF files. However, there's an opportunity to enhance the system by extending support to a broader range of file formats.
  Refine text extraction from pdf file.

- Then run:

```sh
       $ cd ./document_analyse
```

- Run:

```sh
       $ docker-compose build
```

This will run all the initial setups required and start the server.

```sh
       $ docker-compose up
```

- Run the server:

Subsequently, to start and stop the docker containers, you run the following

To start:

```sh
       $ docker-compose start
```

To stop:

- Stop the running container

```sh
       $ docker-compose stop
```

- Stop & remove the running container

```sh
       $ docker-compose down
```
- access docker container by runing this command: docker exec -it <containerId> /bin/sh
- activate the virtual environment : source venv/bin/activate
- run migrations : python3 manage.py makemigrations  then python3 manage.py migrate

#### Hugging face API key
- Visit [hagging face url](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) create a new account and a new api key after email confirmation.
- Create a file named **.env** in the backend/backend folder (same directory with settings.py), with the following content
```
#.env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_DEVELOPMENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/document
API_TOKEN='your token'

```

## Setup Frontend

- Create a file named **.env** in the frontend root folder (same directory with package.json), with the following content
